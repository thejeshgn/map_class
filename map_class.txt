====== Map Class ======
Created Wednesday 11 June 2014 by [[http://thejeshgn.com|Thejesh GN]]

I wrote this for my map class at NID, Bangalore. This was written using [[http://zim-wiki.org/|ZimWiki]] which is an awesome note making software.

This is zimwiki file type if you like to edit.

====== Earth ======

[ ] Shape  
	[ ] Theoretically
		[ ] Sphere 
	[ ] Effect of gravity and rotation 
		[ ] Spheroid or oblate ellipsoid
		[ ] The equatorial diameter is nearly 1/300 longer than polar diameter
[ ] Assuming surface has a constant radius, any point on it is uniquely identified using a polar two-coordinate system
[ ] Selected parallels (in red) and meridians (in blue), here spaced 15° apart, comprise a spherical graticule.
[ ] Longitude is measured from GMT, Latitude  from equator

====== Representaion of Earth ======

[ ] Map is a Representaion   [ Globe(3d) to Map(2D) ]
[ ] Projection - Conversion process and logic
[ ] A geodetic datum is a set of parameters (including axis lengths and offset from true center of the Earth) defining a reference ellipsoid. For each mapped region, a different datum can be carefully chosen so that it best matches average sea level, therefore terrain features.
[ ] Maps are never free from errors
[ ] Distance Measurement
	[ ] Location
	[ ] Area distortion
	[ ] Shapes
	[ ] Directions
[ ] Mercator projection - cylindrical map projection
	{{./pasted_image002.png}}
[ ] [[http://epsg.io/4326|EPSG:4326]] refers to WGS84 earth as an ellipsoid
	[ ] Has metric coordinates, uses lat and long
	[ ] Used by GPS
	[ ] WGS84 Bounds: -180.0000, -90.0000, 180.0000, 90.0000
		 {{./4326_0.png}}
	[ ] For example bangalore is
		{{./4326_1.png}}


[ ] EPSG:900913 (EPSG:3857) Web Mercator refers to WGS84 earth is sphere 
	[ ] Spherical mercator maps use an extent of the world from -180 to 180 longitude, and from -85.0511 to 85.0511 latitude
	[ ] Projection bounds -20026376.39 -20048966.10	20026376.39 20048966.10
	[ ] Initially by Google Maps for tiled maps
	[ ] [[http://crschmidt.net/blog/archives/243/google-projection-900913/|Named]] by openlayers project - 'googlE' (substitute '9' for 'g' and squint a bit)
	[ ] Originally rejected by standards body, then accepted with 3857
	[ ] Used by OpenStreetMap and in general web
	{{./3857.png}}


====== Data Type and Formats ======
	[ ] Raster
		[ ] Images JPEG2000, GeoTIFF
	[ ] Vector
		[ ] Point
		[ ] Line, MultiLine
		[ ] Polygon, Multipolygon
	[ ] Formats
		[ ] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile|ShapeFile]]
			[ ] By ESRI
			[ ] Package .shp (shape), .shx(index), .dbf (attributes) 
		[ ] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text|Well Known Text]] (WKT)
			[ ] Text format
			[ ] Eg: POINT (30 10), LINESTRING (30 10, 10 30, 40 40)
	[ ] Web-Formats
		[ ] KML
		[ ] GeoJSON/TopoJSON

====== Maps Services ======
[ ] Tiled map service
	[ ] URI in REST
	[ ] Simpler than WMS
	[ ] Google, OpenStreetMaps, MapQuest (OSM) or MapBox (OSM), ESRI

[ ] Web Map Service
	[ ] WMS
	[ ] Serves georeferenced map images
	[ ] Serves map in bitmap (PNG, GIF), Can also include vector maps like lines , served as SVG
	[ ] Example, like [[http://bhuvan.nrsc.gov.in|bhuwan]] or [[http://openweathermap.org/api|open weather map]] for data

[ ] SVG Based Maps
	[ ] [[http://jvectormap.com/|Jvector Maps]]
	[ ] [[http://polymaps.org/|Polymaps]]
	[ ] You can manipulate the map the way you do SVG graphics
	[ ] Can be use in conjunction with TMS or can be used independently
	[ ] Works fine on modern web browsers


====== Tools ======
[ ] Desktop
	[ ] QGIS
	[ ] TillMill
[ ] Web
	[ ] [[http://geojson.io|GeoJSON.io]]
	[ ] [[http://leafletjs.com/|Web Map APIs - LeafLet]] 
[ ] Databases
	[ ] Spatial DB (mostly spatial lite)
	[ ] PostGIS


====== Available Data to experiment ======

	[ ] Bangalore Data (Ward maps, BBMP election results, census data at BBMP level)
	[ ] BMTC Data (Bus stops and routes)
	[ ] BWSSB data (Water boundaries)
	[ ] PC and AC data, Election results


====== DO ======

====== Plan ======
	[ ] Ask them what they want to know or do ❄
	[ ] Ask them what they already know ❄
	[ ] Map what they want to know   ↔  what you are going to cover
	[ ] Class
	[ ] Point to resources for the extra/uncovered points
